# What is Qiskit?
Qiskit is an open-source software development kit provided by IBM to use their quantum processors. IBM currently has numerous processors operating with qubits: 27 qubits (Falcon), 65 qubits (Hummingbird), 127 qubits (Eagle), 433 qubits (Osprey), and 1121 qubits (Condor, planned to be ready by the end of 2023).
IBM has crossed 100 qubit barrier in 2021 by engineering 127 qubit processor (Eagle). In 2022, they prepared 433-qubit processor called Osprey. In 2023, they are planning to cross 1000-qubit mark: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03476-5

# What one can do with Qiskit?
Run quantum circuits.
Do quantum gate operations on qubits.
Programming using the quantum processors.
Implementing quantum algorithms.

P.S. Quantum computers, unlike classical computers, do not produce deterministic outcomes. They provide in suporposition of states in probabilistic manner and only collapse once you do measurements. 
Job of algorithms is to utilize this property to make it advantageous in operating certain tasks compared to using classical computers.
